### I highly recomend to open this project with gitpod, so you don't have problems with the installation of some packages...

### Steps to replicate the project:

1. Look at and understand the API's provided that I had to use.
2. Design the wireframes/views.
3. Develop the components used (Navbar, Footer and Card).
4. Create the views and start using the API provided.
5. Develop the Back-End (Second Problem).


### Back-End Manual Installation:

It is recomended to install the backend first, make sure you have Python 3.8, Pipenv and a database engine (In this case Posgress)

1. Install the python packages: `$ pipenv install`
2. Install your database engine (Posgress).
3. Run the application: `$ pipenv run start`


### Front-End Manual Installation:

- Make sure you are using node version 14+ and that you have already successfully installed and runned the backend.

1. Install the packages: `$ npm install`
2. Start the webpack dev server: `$ npm run start`
